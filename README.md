# Malware_Detector
In this project I tested multiple ML model in identifying malware from the PE file headers using this dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johndig90/winpe-ml

as you can see the dataset is unlabbled so it was very difficult to identify the features and their importence to the overall accuracy.
I started with loading the data , exploring it , then cleaning the null values.
It is important to mention that Tree based methods perform better with catigorical features han their other counterparts

also note that the notebook was written on googlecolab and the dataset was imported thei without downloading so if you want to run it locally make sure to delete the first few cells
