# Malware_Detector
In this project I tested multiple ML model in identifying malware from the PE file headers using this dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johndig90/winpe-ml

as you can see the dataset is unlabbled so it was very difficult to identify the features and their importence to the overall accuracy.
I started with loading the data , exploring it , then cleaning the null values.
It is important to mention that Tree based methods perform better with catigorical features han their other counterparts
